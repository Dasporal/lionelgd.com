    description: My name is Lionel, and ever since I've played my first level of Super Mario Bros on the NES, I've been an avid gamer. Like many of us, I only found one thing to be better than playing games, and that was making them ! I pursued a Master's degree specialized in game development and producing at ITESCIA, a school in the Paris Region, where I had the opportunity of learning more about game development and design, while also exploring 3D modeling, sound design, producing and how to lead a small team.

    description: To me, games are all about having a good time. I value the social aspect of games, as well as their unique innovative use of technology. That's why I made games such as Twocan, a couch co-op platformer, and The Book of Gaia, a groundbreaking Augmented Reality wave shooter for iOS and Android. While making a game, I'm especially interested in implementing features and mechanics that players will have fun with, and that feel great to execute.
